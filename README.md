**How to Use the Web App**

If the rightmost tab in the navigation bar is "LOGIN" instead of "PROFILE", then user can only look at requests and group chats but cannot post. Otherwise, the user can post requests as well as message in group chats. 

Click the "LOGIN" tab to register an account, or to login as either a user or an admin. When registering, you will enter:
* mandatory fields including first/last name, username, password, birdthday, location, and 
* optionally qualifications, as well as additional information. 

After registering or logging in, user can see their profile in detail as well as edit them. 

When logged in, clicking "HOME" is equivalent to logging out. If user stays logged in, they can:
* in "REQUESTS", browse and add requests, as well as applying to help a request
* in "GROUP CHATS", message in the group chat.

If the user is an admin, they can delete requests posts and chat messages.
